### In this classic card game, the player (you) will play against a computer. 


### The deck of 52 cards is shuffled each round so that both players get a random card.

### The game starts once you hit the draw button and each player's card will appear.Whoever has the highest card out of the two wins that round and takes the opponent's cards.

### When there is a 'tie' both players deal 4 cards, the last card is put face down and whoever has the highest card, winner takes all.

### First player to 52 wins, or if one player reaches 4 cards, they automatically lose.
