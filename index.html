        <p>&#9825;The deck of <u>52 cards</u> is shuffled each round so that both players get a random card.</p>
        <p>&#9826;The game starts once you hit the draw button. The 52 deck is split evenly so each player will start off with 26 cards.
        <br>Whoever has the highest card out of the two wins that round and takes the opponent's cards.</br><i>2 is the lowest value card, Ace is the highest value card</i></p>
        <p>&#9828;When there is a 'tie' both players deal 4 cards, <br>the last card is put face down and whoever has the highest card, winner takes all.</br></p>
        <p>&#9831;First player to 52 wins, or if one player reaches 4 or less cards, they automatically lose.</p></div>
